# Hardcoded stock prices
stock_prices = {
    "DELL"  : 200
    "CHROME": 350
    "DRIVE" : 140
    "IRTC"  : 430

    if stock == "DONE":

    if stock in stock_prices:
        quantity = int(input("Enter quantity: "))
        price = stock_prices[stock]
        investment = price * quantity
        total_investment += investment
        print(f"Added {stock}: ₹{investment}")
    else:
        print("Stock not found!")
