🎮 Hangman Game (Python)

This project is a console-based Hangman game developed using Python. The game randomly selects a word from a small predefined list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time.
The player is given 6 incorrect attempts to guess the word correctly. For each guess, the program checks whether the letter exists in the secret word. Correct guesses reveal the letter’s position in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses the entire word or runs out of attempts.
This project is designed for beginners to practice core Python concepts such as loops, conditional statements, lists, strings, user input handling, and the random module. It is a simple yet effective way to understand game logic and control flow in Python.

Code:
import random

# List of predefined words
words = ["apple", "python", "cloud", "happy", "world"]

# Choose a random word
secret_word = random.choice(words)
guessed_letters = []
attempts = 6

print("🎮 Welcome to Hangman Game!")
print("Guess the word letter by letter.")

# Game loop
while attempts > 0:
    # Display current progress
    display_word = ""
    for letter in secret_word:
        if letter in guessed_letters:
            display_word += letter + " "
        else:
            display_word += "_ "
    print("\nWord:", display_word.strip())

    # Check if the player has won
    if "_" not in display_word:
        print("🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the word:", secret_word)
        break

    # Take user input
    guess = input("Enter a letter: ").lower()

    # Validate input
    if len(guess) != 1 or not guess.isalpha():
        print("❌ Please enter a single valid letter.")
        continue

    if guess in guessed_letters:
        print("⚠️ You already guessed that letter.")
        continue

    guessed_letters.append(guess)

    # Check if guess is correct
    if guess in secret_word:
        print("✅ Good guess!")
    else:
        attempts -= 1
        print("❌ Wrong guess! Attempts left:", attempts)

# If attempts are over
if attempts == 0:
    print("\n💀 Game Over! The word was:", secret_word)
